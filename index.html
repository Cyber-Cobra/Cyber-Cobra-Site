<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>We are a game studio where we make side scrollers that are similar to older games like Megaman and Metroid. However we are planning to make 3d games in the future to expand our games. We’re a small company with three employees which are ourselves. We program games and then sell them to other companies. This company was created because we have always loved games and wanted to make them so over the years we learned and then we began the company. We are still trying to expand in everything, like the number of games and employees due to the slow process of creating our games. We will get new workers by hiring new people to help us in our mission by holding contests. Other things we plan to do in the course of our mission is to get an official headquarters, which we will work in and obtain by working and saving our money.</p>
<h2>Product Line</h2>
<p>Our products mainly include modernized games that in graphics are similar to retro-style games, but enhanced and changes made in order to fit the modern market and its wants. The topic of the games will vary greatly. The gameplay of our first games would  vary based segments, with some being sidescrollers, and others being from a slanted birds-eye-view. This will allow our games have variety of gameplay mechanics and environments. Players will also see many amazing settings, graphics, characters, enemies, and bosses. As we grow over time we plan to expand our games to other genres and mechanics. These games will hopefully help many relax and have fun after a long day's work.
We plan to differ from other developers due to our products mainly being inspired from retro style games. We also focus on the environments and the enemies faced to be detailed and interesting. Combined with a fun plot to make  an unique game, as well as the mystery and hidden plot in most to all of our games, creating a differentiation from others to make our iconic game, plots for recognition.The average product life cycle in our games would be around 3-4 years on average, a game’s life cycle circling around the concise it is being sold in. Of course, if our games sell extremely well and we create enough revenue to fulfill the requests we made for our funders, then we extend our games’ life cycles to be around in the next gen consoles.</p>
<h3>Organization and Managements</h3>
<p>When beginning a new game idea, our main set point is to keep our debts and access to resources in mind.  We make sure we stick to our budget by analyzing each thing we need for our game like what type of programming we need, and other equipment and if we have that or not. If we do not have the equipment, then we see what is the best and cheapest equipment we can find so we stay under our budget. In order to create revenue, we need to comprehend the importance of business margins. Of course, in order to create a successful product we need to take into consideration our funds and splitting them into profit and the cost of creation, advertisements, etc. This gap is called margins. We need to make profit that would be enough to keep the business from closing down and feeding our families I guess. For this we need to take into consideration how much of a product is mass produce and at what priced. To do so, we need to use the margin gap to the most possible effect. As such, we organized our fund usage on 40% research and material cost, and 30% on advertisements. 20% would be used in order to gradually pay back our kickstarter, and the rest of the margin is the difference form creating the product and the unit sale price. This would be managed by the “Brainstormers” AND A MANAGER OF THE HEAD FACTORY. Then after finally going through that process, when we make changes to the idea, we go through it again. This company has 3 managers. Two of them are Fahmid Hossain and Jaden Ordonez. They received high grades in school and then became programmers as they developed their love for it and they also played a few games in school and they are also the main programmers. The tester, David Lam has loved games since he was a child and that interested him. Although he wasn’t really into programming and wasn’t too good in school, he loved games so he became the tester.</p>
